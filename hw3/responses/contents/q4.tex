\prompt{Show that Jeffrey's priors satisfy the invariance principle}

In Jeffrey's view, a prior is non-informative if the prior chosen for $p_{\psi}(\psi)$ is proportional to the pdf that appears with the transformation $p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta)) = p_\psi(\psi)$.
The Jeffrey's prior for $p(\psi)$ would be $\big|I(\psi)\big|^{1/2}$ and the pdf of the transformation $p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta)) = p_\psi(\psi)$ is a well-known result if $g$ is monotone, i.e. $p_\psi(\psi)= p_\theta(g^{-1}(\psi))\big|\partiald{}{\psi}g^{-1}(\psi)\big|$.
Therefore, I need to show that $p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta)) \propto \big|I(\psi)\big|^{1/2}$.
Starting from the pdf of the transformation $p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta))$:
\begin{align*}
    p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta))&= p_\theta(g^{-1}(\psi))\big|\partiald{}{\psi}g^{-1}(\psi)\big|\\
                             &=\big|\secpartiald{}{\theta}\log(p_\theta(y\big|\theta=g^{-1}(\psi)))\big|^{1/2}\big|\partiald{}{\psi}g^{-1}(\psi)\big|\\
                              \Rightarrow\\
p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta))^2 &= \big|\secpartiald{}{\theta}\log(p_\theta(y\big|\theta=g^{-1}(\psi)))\big|\big|\partiald{}{\psi}g^{-1}(\psi)\big|^2\\
                             &= I(g^{-1}(\psi))\big|\partiald{}{\psi}g^{-1}(\psi)\big|^2\\
\end{align*}
From here I need to use a special property of Fisher information.
This property relates the information of paramater to the fisher information of a function of a parameter.
It states that if $\alpha$ and $\beta = h(\alpha)$ are scalar parameters and if $h$ is a continuously differentiable function, then the Fisher information of the two parameterizations are related by the following equation:
\begin{align*}
    I(\alpha) &= I(h(\alpha))(\frac{d }{d\alpha}h(\alpha))^2\\
\end{align*}
This is tricky for me to prove, but it seems to be a well known result.
Using this property and letting $h = g^{-1}$ I get:
\begin{align*}
     p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta))^2 &= I(g^{-1}(\psi))\big|\partiald{}{\psi}g^{-1}(\psi)\big|^2\\
                                &= I(\psi)^2\\
                              \Rightarrow\\
     p_{\theta}(\psi=g(\theta)) &= I(\psi)^{1/2}\\
\end{align*}
Which is the Jeffrey's prior for $p(\psi)$ that I needed to prove.
% there is a property of Fisher information that states that under a reparameterization $h: \alpha \rightarrow \beta$, 
%
% \begin{align*}
%                               &\propto \big|\secpartiald{}{\psi}\log(p_\psi(y\big|\psi))\big|^{1/2}
% \end{align*}
