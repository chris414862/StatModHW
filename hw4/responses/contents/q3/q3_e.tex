It seemed that the location only models produced more reliable results. 
Allowing the variance parameters to update allowed the excess centroids to increase the log-likelihood arbitrarily by decreasing the variance to zero.
This is why I limited the minimum $\sigma^2$'s.

It also appeared that initialization played a large role in the goodness of fit. 
The resulting mixture pdf's could vary substantially on repeated runs.
